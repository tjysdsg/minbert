0 ||| i did not enjoy this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , nina foch,(julia ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs. hughes , ( dame may witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and , conveniently , julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . george macready , ( ralph hughes ) is the son of mrs. hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . unfortunately , this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . this stereotypical strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there are the prerequisite secret doors and absolutely no suspense .

0 ||| we start all of our reviews with the following information . my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . the point of this is that critics count for zero . your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! we never ever listen or read the critics . we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . well enough about that.<br /><br />now this movie is actually very bad . not just bad but very bad . for a change , the critics are spot on . partly because there is nudity and language they hated it . it was n't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for . is that not right ? not every movie can not be an academy award nominee . sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it 's no mystery as to what the critics want .

0 ||| it is hard to describe bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . it follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release . as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought , the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep , waiting anxiously to see when the movie will ever end . and as far as the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . it simply does'nt work.<br /><br />this movie is pure snoozefest . it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry will always have . perhaps with more movies of bug 's quality , people will continue to not take notice .
1 ||| watch mission : galactica and watch the original living legend episodes . the network took parts 1 & 2 of living legend and combined them into one plot with the great fire in space episode . although galactica suffered from network - controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series . fire in space , on its own , is one of the best episodes . as a historical note , watch galactica , the original star trek , and then the revival trek series , and you 'll see the difference in quality between network - produced sci - fi and syndicated sci - fi .

1 ||| the plot is smooth . the acting is far north of a jr. high school play . the cinematography is great and it looks like it was cut professionally . i could easily decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film . think death valley days meets mayberry rfd . people running around in a ' lawless ' modern town wearing quick - draw 6 gun rigs . it has its fair share of ' cutsey ' stuff . picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house , and parking the ford mustang right in front of a hitching rail . picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western ( hemisphere ) movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub - titles . it 's all really well - done and might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote . it 's a real gem without modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of . there 's even a modern version of the good hearted dance - hall girl , and a twanging jew's - harp in the soundtrack . really ! if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session , tell 'em your dvd player just got fixed .
1 ||| another strong third - season entry , ' is there in truth no beauty ? ' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say , fascinating . the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane . it 's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible premise . obviously , i think , it was a clever move to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual visage in every way   approximates such a daunting build - up ; what we get is the exceptional star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . in any event , kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by mr. spock , and then only if spock is wearing a special visor . ( for the longest time , i thought the alien 's name was ' carlos , ' which i found humorous , but i digress . ) spock is required to mind - meld with kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety . this is accomplished , but when spock / kollos go back to end the mind - meld , by golly , spock forgets his visor . uh oh . he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of kollos ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic powers . this was a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is also expertly directed and comes across as yet one more perfectly executed show of the series ' last season .

1 ||| my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie ? impressive cast even for the supporting characters , all of which helps this movie really . i have to admit , tom hank 's cameo made it worth it  what was that about tom ? did you lose a bet ? the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though - by far a classic ! the premise is good . basinger 's character , struggling with existence as a pink lady , is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . this happens as corbett 's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex - wife motivated by .what else .extortion . as they both make their way , they have numerous run - ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas . soon , the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer . fortunately , premise and the movie were both good.<br /><br />when watching this movie , imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity are n't really important . it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing does n't really make sense . the movie tries hard , and ultimately succeeds . ultimately , it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.<br /><br />it is n't the best , but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one !

1 ||| this movie has some really beautiful sets and albert finney doe an amazing job as the ruthless father . the movie works because jennifer jason leigh jump as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de havilland 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in the heiress ( 1949 ) . the film 's feminist - leaning conclusion also goes after the austere conclusion of the novel , washington square , whose author , henry james , savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels . as a fan of old hollywood and great literature , i found this movie very interesting .
1 ||| i   gave this hilarious comedy horror flick its score because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it .   a group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada , run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes and wrong turn .   there 's only one mutant on display , but he is really impressive . sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago . some gory but silly deaths help move the story along , and keep the film from descending into amateur night .   it is   engaging beyond belief . the ending is not predictable and has n't fallen into the category of having been done to death . no pun intended .

1 ||| platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to heavyweight championship boxing . oliver stone 's story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in 1968 is not overdone it 's not laughable . while most or all of the occurrences in platoon did occur over the 10 + year span of us military involvement in vietnam , to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame ( weeks ) gives a great picture of the war . in platoon , the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two : us soldiers murdering civilians , us soldiers raping civilians , a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant , a us private murdering a us staff sergeant , us soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon . for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace . two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers ( the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam ) and hbo 's a bright shining lie .

1 ||| what a great excuse for new zealnd movie making . i 'm proud to call myself a new zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv ( aug 2006 ) . the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars . the ship , in real life , is one of the inter - island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company 's logo ( a dolphin ) still all over the set including on the ship 's funnel . the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the usa and mexico . it has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it 's maiden voyage . one of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of new zealand 's south island in the background ! must have been a very cold time on the usa / mexico area ! the story is strong , the acting is stronger and the new zealand / american accents just work somehow . i expect the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a wise spending of money . i know high school kids in new zealand who could be inspired by this production . goof : there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck , presumably to make it look like it was american . but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you 'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it , but perhaps it was intentional because it worked . i 'd love to go on but it it 's so gripping you need to watch it for yourself .

0 ||| the whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . and it failed miserably in doing so . the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young loren , handsome della marra , and a slinky ms. maxwell)who make the story much less believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music   even less a chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . altogether , a disappointing introduction to one of verdi 's great works . i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly did n't awaken my interest in opera , a form with which i was then not well acquainted . i still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals . luciano della marra was a let down as radames , and fortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .

1 ||| i am a huge fan of the comic book series , and this movie exceeded my expectations . i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it ..... slow moving , bad dialogue , lots o ' blood ..... and this was better than anything i could have imagined . < br /><br />the plot line is almost the same as the comic . the characters have all of the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series . the movie covers   the comic , and it 's quite interesting . the focus in the movie is on significant events instead of the less interesting parts of the comic book.<br /><br />with the right people working on this project , it has been amazing . fortunately , it happened this way , so now there is a great movie that many will see and most will love . my copy will surely not collect dust for years as i 'll watch it often .
0 ||| i 'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor , sorry for that ... <br /><br />this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air . i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title , i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7/10 , that 's pretty poor.<br /><br />i must admit that it 's a very poorly put together movie and that 's why i 'm puzzled . was this the only film made by this director ... ? how come he did n't make lots of films after this rather good one ... ? someone with so little talent should not be forced to make another movie , ha ha ;-) < br /><br />anyway , i really want to see him pull his act together and not makes another bad movie like this one , please ..... ?
0 ||| i first saw this absolutely dull documentary in it 's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a negative effect on me , so much that i bugged several of my friends to skip it with me on repeat screenings . the bottom line : none of my friends walked away impressed ( ever ! ) . this stupid film is about scottish conceptual artist , andy goldsworthy , who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials ( wood , water , flowers , rocks , etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form ( a statement in the temporary state of everything ? ) . we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art , as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world , as well as a few pieces in the natural world , as well . german film maker , thomas riedelsheimer directs , photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear ( with a weak musical score , composed & performed by fred frith , who 's music is generally edgy experimental / noise textured guitar , as well as a capable ensemble of musicians ) . although this film has been available on dvd for some years now , if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film , by all means , avoid it ( it 's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen , with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way ) . no mpaa rating , but contains nothing to offend ( unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb )

1 ||| east palace , west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective , with frank sinatra in the role of the cop , and william windom is the boy . it 's a progressive film for china , i guess , and it does n't perpetuate myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles . the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . he cruises the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer . and that in fact happens . then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to squat for a period of time , handcuffed , slapped . this is what the gay man wants , and , implicitly , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . the story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes wonderful . it becomes a cry of pity for china 's gays , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society . thankfully , i can relate .

0 ||| i m not usually a lover of musicals , but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely not be oliver . this film is so badly made , the characters are not well depicted , the costumes are way off the acting is bad and the songs are terrible , my least favourite being ' reviewing the situation'sung by ron moody who gives an awful portrayal of fagin . i was n't old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were , so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs , usually it was ' who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . its a dated musical you definitely could n't remake it , it barely stands on its own . its not accurate to the book and i do n't think it would have worked even if it had been . i think charles dickens would be disappointed , as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london , the orphanages , the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive , and the film portrays this badly . also another reason not to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier , notice his long thin legs , this was bred out of the breed many years ago , they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him , and he is nowhere close to how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times . notice he has scars { which is probably makeup}on his face , bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . his a beautiful dog any way , and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy , he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was . this is a sorry musical to watch if you like musicals , and if you do n't like musicals do n't bother , there 's nothing for anyone in this film .

1 ||| - i had planned to write something explaining what i liked about this movie , but this is going to be more difficult than i thought . honestly , i remember so much about it . i watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost a great impression on me . that 's usually the sign of a real winner . one the only thing i remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it . the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look - a - like as the detective never wore off .. it would be different if he could n't act , but he 's a complete entertainer . the kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them . if you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see less euro horror . the casting is n't a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
0 ||| artistically speaking , this is a poor movie -- the cinematography , music and costumes are ugly . in fact , this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by akira kurasawa himself . in this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />so , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting . the story was also rather depressing and uninvolving in some ways -- after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel . it 's confusing that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan , the women still long for a better life . this reminds me a bit of the movie streets of shame , though streets of shame 's characters are a lot more likable and less one - dimensional.<br /><br />so , overall it gets a 2 - -due to everything , but especially the writing . it 's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great kurasawa .
1 ||| this movie is a lucid collection of multiple themes from recent cinema . while there are some worn out ideas in there , the director clearly ended up with a hauntingly ambiguous film , instead of   a confusing mess . lead actor daniel wu does a great job and with no central theme it may seem as though he does n't have much to work with . but the movie is loaded with scares ( and there are some really creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*mild spoilers*<br /><br />we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin , diabolical librarians , ghostly love interests , identity confusion , death by savage monkeys , oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers , sublimated homosexuality , and crime gang connections . the commonality these elements share cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent . < br /><br />perhaps the most interesting aspect to this film is that despite the brother 's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover , the act itself is never directly portrayed . instead , director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - brilliant!<br /><br />*end spoilers*<br /><br />see this one . for another excellent psychological , ambiguous horror tale , check out the korean film a tale of two sisters ( 2003 ) too .

0 ||| i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months . i was actually surprised at how bad it was.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty . they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned.<br /><br />a few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />at the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . but , marty is in the hospital with severe burns . although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />the acting is terrible but that is not even the worst part.<br /><br />i hate the story . i ca n't sympathize with marty . it 's like tamara ( 2005 ) . the bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />i would strongly recommend anyone to avoid this if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />i give this movie 0 stars out of 10 . awful cheesy slasher !
0 ||| actually my vote is a 3.5 . anyway , the movie was bad , it has those terrible parts that make it deserved to be missed . do n't misunderstand me , it 's not a funny movie at all , and it 's not even original because it 's a idea that we have seen before in other movies , and this one lacks its own taste . a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends ... i think that not exactly but who cares ? also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic . chris rock appears in it . the name is down to earth , men . that one is also an unfunny movie . see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr. rock undeservedly won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher , the film is bad .

0 ||| so halfway through the season , i got so caught up in school and my activities that i did n't realize that the show had finally been canceled halfway through , which is expected.<br /><br />i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them for an apology . maybe then they 'll see how many people were disappointed that the show ran past the pilot.<br /><br />i despised the show and did not look forward to it taking up a 30 minute block every thursday after the oc . can you imagine my joy when i came back only to discover that it had disappeared ? needless to say , i 'm very happy with fox right now . even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed . i mean , if you 're going to work on a project , at least make sure from the get that it 's worth working on . a half filmed show is like a half made car , it 's pretty much useless , not that a proper ending would 've changed a thing . fox , do better .

1 ||| i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga , compelling storyline , cool soundtrack , directing ( kitamura rocks ! ) , editing , and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly . so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2 , and after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and cashed the ticket : ( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off , however these are completely 2 different movies . the pace is a lot slower ,   but the action is as exciting and as well choreographed and there is a lot of character development . this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further increasing the value of the toho monster franchise ( if that is possible ! ) . i disagree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . it 's good that ryuhei kitamura did not continue with this installment . there is also some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . even the real bad guys , get killed off easily without too much of a fight . the fight with the spider guy ( straight out of an episode of monkey ! ) in the bamboo forest was the most memorable fight scene . wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam ! ! azumi 's rampage at the end was convincing ,   and aya still does an okay job . she looks great in the cape ... but where did she get it from ? i think i will be watching this one over and over again ! ... what a great movie .

( update : i should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception . she is by no means wooden . not that she 's good , but she certainly is n't wooden . ) even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness , but with this one , there does n't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about . and you know the funniest thing ? they clearly expected to make a sequel ! it 's so good and great that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way . i sat en - rapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of not making a sequel .

0 ||| this film , along with westfront 1918 , are my less favorite pabst - directed films and i disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks ( such as pandora 's box ) . it 's probably because both are very similar to the neo - realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . this style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />in this case , the film is about french and german coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners -- not actors . the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco - german border . instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine , despite there being greater unemployment in germany . this , language differences ( illustrated   in a dance hall scene ) and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions -- resulting in a we vs. they mentality . later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . not risking their own lives , they prove that there is false comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />the film is a weak criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . it was a horrible film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen . considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at worst . it 's a real shame , as like this one , westfront 1918 , jáaccuse ( gance ) and all quiet on the western front ( milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in negatively swaying public opinion . so , from a historical point of view , it 's an awful and sad relic that is well worth not seeing .

0 ||| back in his youth , the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin , but his family forbid it . many decades later , the old man has raised three children ( two boys and one girl ) , and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children . soon , the sister is bored with brother # 1 , and jumps in the bed of brother # 2.<br /><br />one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island . but no -- they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non - related female and the two brothers . never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non - related male and the one sister . all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />the most intriguing part of gladiator was the incest thing . the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage - minded girls all over him , but no -- he only wanted his sister . if movie incest is your cup of tea , then sunshine will ( slowly ) thrill you to no end .

1 ||| there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film : major chick davis ( pat o'brien ) . o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets -- the bombardier . but he is so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly . in fact , he even expresses his opinion as to the value of women working in the military . he 's tough when he has to be , yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor , roles he perfected in other films . his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves . o'brien seems natural in the role , and plays it in fine fashion . two things help this movie : o'brien 's performance and the spectacular special effects ending .

0 ||| it 's such a shame thing that because of it 's title this film will be watched by people who love football . bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick . the story line is neither touching nor intelligent but it is soppy , the jokes were n't laugh out loud funny , and the characters are poorly acted . parminder nagra and keira knightley are dumb teenagers jess and jules , putting in bad performances both on and off the pitch . anupam kher is horrible as jess ' worried father , and jonathan rhys - meyers , who was so amazingly evil in ' ride with the devil , ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once , making full use of his gorgeous irish accent ! even if you like football , do not go see this film . if anything it 'll make you frown .
1 ||| ok , but does that make this a good movie ? actually , yes , in my opinion.there is a whole lot to recommend.i found it very slow - paced , in fact.it 's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable , but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times , which i   really think fits this series and the character . jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he 's a decent actor , and i felt he played his character too good.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie , which was great . i liked the movie . plus , there were some pretty funny one liners . arnold vosloo returns in the title role , but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved , as i had hoped.this is just my opinion.anyway , for me , while this movie is not amazing , it is pretty great.my vote for darkman iii : 4.5/5
1 ||| wow , what a film . definately one of bacon 's best films . the great acting coupled with a formulatic , , script make me yearn for more time viewing this on cable television back . not really much i can say about it , a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he 's recruiting , who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by ( spoiler ) a basketball game . grade : a+

0 ||| dislike this film also . saw it when it was first shown i8n germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt . it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere too . the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that . in his genre it was an overly ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />it does n't exist much copies of that film , mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />for the people who wish to see that movie again , you could find it on his homepage which is n't that easy to search for but its possible .
0 ||| turned out to be a bad production with what must have been a low budget . the variety of characters is lacking , from axe - wielding dwarfs to 7 ft ghouls ! i disliked the relationship between the leads , not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going . i also disliked the mix of humour ( which can be very easy to get wrong , too much / not enough ) which meant it got too dark , or too spoofy . it was a great step up from eaves ' other efforts , hellbreeder and sanitarium , in terms of storyline and production . they have a boring website which is not worth checking out . ca n't wait for bane , if the level of improvement continues , it should be better .
1 ||| it 's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn - on for intrigued audiences . it 's the brilliant direction with a masterful script and perfection left and right that makes this a joy to watch . i 'm not sorry to say i do see the ' fun ' in this . just the thrill of the clever filming and one - liners . well , i 'm not wondering how high the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced . probably even better than that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound .   genius ! did i forget to mention this sheriff 's not only a great actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh ? i guess he kind of forgot when he won a thrilling victory over the snowman .

1 ||| i understand how these animated movies keep coming out , and no matter how good ( or great ) it is people love it.<br /><br />i saw this movie with my two kids ( 5,7 ) . they like pretty much anything animated ( like most people who rated this film ) . the theater was almost full , and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast . to tell the truth i was completely entertained . it was unbelievably unpredictable and just plain funny . there were a million chuckles throughout the film and that was great . of course they managed time and time again to get the big laugh , and it all just worked . my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie , and he did so on this one , too . my daughter never fell asleep , which she usually does half way through . also , the kids thought the character animation looked great . i have n't heard that from them since seeing the polar express , which gave my daughter thrills.<br /><br />trust me , i 'm not the type who looks for the positive in everything . but quality is quality , and like so many animated movies they put out there , it has very much .
0 ||| although well past the target audience , i 've always had a soft spot for ya fiction , so , i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screen.<br /><br />this is a bad film . the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth . nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously , so young audience members will be upset.<br /><br />what i really hated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />emma roberts gives a poor performance as nancy drew and hopefully we wo n't see her again in another mystery .

0 ||| here 's another film that does n't really need much of a recommendation . it 's a   comedy , but not very funny or entertaining and which , of course , ultimately ruined a   television series which many would say was even worse ( i hated both , personally ) . < br /><br />for some , it 's hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman ( or perhaps vice versa ) . but what we 've got there in both cases are four mediocre actors who in real life do n't seemed   much like their film counterparts that they do n't managed to make these characterizations their own . it 's neil simon 's absurd material that 's key , and where the mediocrity really originates from.<br /><br />for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple , it 's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat - freak ( lemmon ) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long - suffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy ( matthau ) . pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely tiring predicaments .
